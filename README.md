# Pretty Printer

I often find pieces of writing that I'd like to print out and keep somewhere. This is
a tool I can use when inspiration strikes to do that. 

## How best to use it.

1. Fill out the form with the content, title, and author (optional).
2. Click 'print' and when the 'print' dialogue comes up click 'More Settings' and unselect 'Print headers and footers' (firefox)
or 'Headers and Footers' (chrome)
3. To scale the content to your page use the custom scale settings.

> Unfortunately, on mobile (iOS), there is no option to 'Remove Headers and Footers'.
